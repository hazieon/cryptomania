# Cryptomania

The MVP (minimum viable product) of this app is a minimalistic cryptocurrency tracker,
Using React.js, CSS and axios to carry out API calls.
Users can view the current price (per coin), daily change in price, daily % change in price and hourly % change in price.
☆NEW☆ Market cap and coin supply data now viewable!
View the app here: https://cryptomaniaa.netlify.app

## How to use this app
1. 'git clone' to copy the repo to your machine
2. (get an API key and add it to your local .env file)
3. 'npm i' in the project folder to install the dependencies 
4. 'npm start' to run the app in your browser

## MLP goals (Minimum Loveable Product)
With more time and preminum access to the API, I would add historical data charts to show the fluctutations of the data over a longer time period.

I would add user login and profiles, allowing users to specify 'favourite' cryptocurrencies to follow.

As a stretch goal, it would be great to allow users to build pie charts of their cryptocurrency holdings. 
This feature is not seen on other crypto sites.
